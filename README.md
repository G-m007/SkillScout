SkillScout is a job portal platform designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers by streamlining the recruitment process. It features a recommendation system that matches candidates to job opportunities based on their skills, qualifications, and other attributes like CGPA, certifications, and electives. Built using the MERN stack with MySQL as the database, SkillScout emphasizes an efficient backend for managing data, enhanced UI/UX for users, and analytical tools for employers to assess potential candidates effectively.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started with SkillScout

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
